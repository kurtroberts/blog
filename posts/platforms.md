#If you think the platform will save you, watch out for the sharks...

There's a stereotype that technology professionals love to debate what the best way to solve a given problem is. Proprietary vs Open Source.  .NET vs Java.  Chrome vs Firefox.  Windows vs Mac vs Linux.  WordPress vs Drupal.  Apache vs IIS vs nginx.  Git vs Subversion.  They'll spend hours upon hours at this.  Then when they finish, they'll get into a fight about whether you should indent your code using tabs or spaces, and whether you should be designing your website from a desktop or mobile perspective first.

In the mean time, the rest of us non-zealots would like to get some work done.

There's an adage in the PERL world, known as the PERL motto: "There's more than one way to do it."  For a number of years, PERL reigned as the "duct-tape of the Internet," letting developers hack together solutions that worked without going through complex data modelling and top down design exercises that seemed so academic and stuffy to the guy that just wanted to get a form to send him an email.  

Along came Dreamweaver, empowering a generation of graphic designers to make their own pages.  Developers complained about trashy markup (which it was) and designers couldn't understand why a developer couldn't just "fix this one quick thing" in their busted table layout without taking hours changing a bunch of "unrelated" stuff.

Ah the good-old-days.  It makes me kind of nostalgic, by which I mean nauseous - for two reasons.  The first is those developers created a gigantic, valuable mess, which happens to be called the Internet, and to this day we have to deal with their bad decisions.

The second is that very loud-mouthed set of technology professionals is still at it, continuing to perpetuate the myths.

It's come up so many times in my career that I often wonder if I spent part of my adult life as a philosophy professional who happens to accidentally produce technology once in a while, rather than a technologist who has a philosophy habit on the side, but of course we need to raise the ugly spector of "The Hedgehog and the Fox" here.

The key to strong systems thinking is being a fox.  And that means a little more than just knowing a little about a lot of things.  It means also knowing that you don't know a lot of things, and working tirelessly to find them out.

I had a former employer tell me we could no longer be technology agnostic, because it doesn't sell.  That seems like a long time ago - I'm hard pressed to remember the last time I sold a particular technology solution in a pitch.  

You choose to use a platform because it puts you farther along on the road to building the solution you're trying to build.  Depending on what you're doing, you make a series of compromises between convenience and precision.  

We use WordPress for a lot of things here, and we use node.js for a lot of other things, but I'd rather choke myself with the tie I keep on the back of the door for surprise client meetings than claim to be a "WordPress shop" or a "node shop".  And neither of those elicit the violent reaction from me that thinking about becoming a "Microsoft-certified partner" does.

I had an ExpressionEngine consultant in recently to help with a technology evaluation for a client, and he complimented us on how "fast and responsive" we'd made a site we were hosting.  Little did he realize we didn't spend hours and days fine-tuning the site that we inherited from another vendor to deal with all the client's complaints.  We just moved it onto AWS and set up CloudFront caching and a static failover.

In a past life, I ran one of DC's most advanced .NET shops.  At RP3, we tend to pay more homage to the open source tools that let me develop my programming skills in the first place, without paying a $1000 tax to Microsoft for Visual Studio.  But I want to make it clear - I'm putting my eggs in the basket of people who understand technology fluently, and can think systemically.  Not in the basket of people who are experts on a given system.

Remember - all platforms suck.  Because platforms are about trading complexity.  Platforms that make the risk managers happy (they have a company behind them you can sue if they fail) probably tick off developers who can't see how something works or extend basic functionality in it.  Platforms that make developers happy are probably awful to deal with as an actual user of the system.
