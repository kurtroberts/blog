Everyone has suffered from writer's block at some point.  You know what you have to write, and just can't seem to put words together to say anything.  Or you know you have a looming assignment and no big idea.

Getting started is the hardest part.  I had a teacher tell me to do just this -- start writing about writer's block -- as a way to get past it.  That's not what I'm doing right now.

Writers don't have a monopoly on writer's block. It happens to everyone who creates things.  Some of it is habit, or growing comfortable with your creative space and your process.  Some of it is a result of needing an injection of new inspiration; the things you've been using for reference are looking old and tired.

Start again, an attempt at an outline.  I've already fixed the title, thank you @indianaexpat.

- Trying to build different things means adopting new ways to work
	- adopting agile principles
	- taking advantage of design capabilities of HTML/CSS
	- working with low cost hardware prototyping tools
- We think there's a better way to design software
- Software is a better way to design software
	- Simpler, more accurate
	- Try out ideas
	- Align the team faster

The Internet changed the way we share ideas, and the way we work - it's a giant, messy work in progress, created by lots of people, working towards different end-states (or no idea what end-state they want at all).  It's perpetually unfinished, requiring revisions, late on the next version, and that's okay.  More than okay, it's the defining invention of our time.

Stop for a moment.  That's a powerful idea, and it's radically changed the way we work, even if you don't build software for a living.  Whether you're in an industry that thinks (and [pontificates](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EveryoneShouldBeaRobot) [ad](http://kanbanblog.com/explained/) [nauseum](https://github.com/codylindley/frontend-tools)) about [how](http://www.scrumalliance.org/) [it](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/map/project.html) [works](http://agilemanifesto.org/), like software engineers do, or one, like [DC taxi cab drivers in the Uber era](http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/capitalcomment/local-news/sidecar-and-uberx-say-proposed-taxi-regulations-would-drive-them-out-of-dc.php), that has been altered by the speed at which the Internet connects us, your job has been altered by it.  Gone, for example, is the mandantory (and glorious) offline time that used to be part of travel - we have onboard wifi now, be it a train, plane or automobile.  You're online, and on - there's no time between thinking and doing, and a bad connection is only half of an excuse.

The web is different than any media that came before it.  It works because it is incredibly simple to change, and because the changes are so close to the ideas that lead to those changes.  Websites are very malleable, allowing you to reconfigure and re-assemble them to your hearts desire and your mind's (dis)content.  Your idea can take shape immediately, with just a few keystrokes and a little patience. (Ignore your IT department - it is actually quite easy to CHANGE.  Just delete the site you are dealing with and start from scratch.)

So why is actually programming the last thing teams do when they build a website?  If software is so close to the original idea, why do we create representational sketches (let's call them wireframes), acyclic graphs of pages (let's call them sitemaps), high-resolution images (let's call them comps), and pages upon pages of technical requirements documents (let's call this procrastination) before we start programming, when the whole team could be making a working system better the whole time?

AFAIK, it's because we can't shake the idea that change in requirements or strategy is to be feared in the "production" process.  In screen printing, it means you've burned screens that have to be thrown away.  In marble sculpting, you've screwed up a really big piece of expensive rock.  For software, it's a latent fear, left over from when computer programs ran on paper punch cards, and you had to wait for your timeslot on the university machine to run your program and see what happened.  One mistake could mean you didn't get to try again until a week or month later, depending on how many other programmers were timesharing the machine.

That issue disappeared in the late 1960's, with the death of punch cards and the advent of electromagnetic media (like tape, and more recently, modern solid state drives).  Programming for the web couldn't be more different from the punch-card days. The cost of change is so low - considering the open source movement, virtualization, low-cost and embedded computing platforms, the availability of technical education, ever advancing software with metaprogramming capabilities ([IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/), for example) - that the real question becomes "why aren't you out there, trying things out?".

RP3 has that culture of trying new things - we've experimented with [rebranding the agency after an NFL pick](http://rp3agency.com/#work-rg3-case-0), [Twitter-enabled holiday decorations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr9cJz1v2og&index=6&list=PLPVrsyZE5W2R105TlmdQy76-NA7Sw1KK_), and [a robot that could write](#).  It's been done in a skunkworks fashion for a long time, and today we're proud to make it official by launching our innovation lab, RPR&amp;D.

Sure, lots of big agencies have innovation labs, but too often the idea of a lab is merely lip-service to a culture of innovation.  So what if you have a 3D printer and a laser cutter on site?  How does that change your culture and the outputs your creative process produces?

What if an agency our size was to embrace the lab concept at the highest level, and question not just what we could create, but how we approach problems?  What if we designed a website the way we approached that twitter-connected tree, by playing with the end product, rather than requirements artifacts?  How would that affect the team and the design process?  Better yet, what would happen if we did it publicly?

RPR&amp;D now brings you [RP3.io](http://rp3.io/), our publicly available prototype site.  We're working and designing the next generation of our website in real time, making a usable finished product as we go.

THIS PARAGRAPH IS PROBABLY THE MOST CONVTROVERSIAL IN THIS PIECE:

We're taking this one step further and making our source code public on [our Github page](http://github.com/rp3agency/).  That means you can go view our work, read the code and see how we think about these problems.  The solutions will change as we experiment, but our thought process will always be public and available for review, as we post new ideas to the prototype site.

We're excited to see how this turns out - we're sure it's for the better.  And we're interested in how you're changing the way you work to adapt to the new demands on time and innovation placed upon your job.  Let us know in the commments.
