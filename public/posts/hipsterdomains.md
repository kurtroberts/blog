#Eh, I saw these domain names before they were famous. 

Recently, we got an email from [hover](http://hover.com/) touting the fact that [new hipster domains](http://www.hover.com/blog/on-sale-now-hipster-domains/) are available.  Non-traditional top-level domains are truly a 21st century problem - as little as 20 years ago, very few Americans would have recognized a .com domain.  Now that the pool of desireable .com domains is drying up (a former employer of mine paid $15K for a 7 letter .com domain), what's a brand to do but choose one of the newly released alternatives?

Over the past few years, there's a surprising amount of controversy out there regarding opening up the space for more top level domains.  For some, it's a [Western corporate power grab](http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/18/4533740/icann-signs-first-four-gtld); for others, it's been about the [morality of porn related domain names](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/12/icann_gtld_expansion_religious_war/).  Most pertinently to brands, perhaps, is the fear that it will put a [huge burden on brands protecting their intellectual property and trademarks](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:5DFH7JsZj5EJ:www.ana.net/getfile/17269+ANA+Defensive+Registration&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgw8zwmCSpnkIo1nKPgAlXw2GUA7ce_EIgg-fetExmGpK1_NGkfjYLOjeAbvuIDQJL1G1A4n_8Pr9ogq-_1tRUketIC0vUxYILk9_sOAx6TkmvmLclEBD2pTRb1Akv2RBpnluf7&sig=AHIEtbRWN-b8W_RnAjyWXFYNoEfJkWVvLg).

However, as Hover's announcement above shows, the scene is set and these domains are here to stay.  So what to do with them?

We wondered how these domains held up from a consumer-behavoir standpoint, so we decided to ask Omar, our Director of Strategic Planning.  We were in luck - he had direct experience with this problem.  

> "When I worked on [a large software company] in the past, our research found people don't care as much about the .com, and that it didn't really affect findability.  Most people would google the name and then click on a link.  After that the browser autocomplete takes over, so when they would go back, they'd type 3 or 4 letters and choose the right link from the autocomplete drop down.  Consumers rarely have to remember a full URL." - Omar Quinones

During our discussion, Omar tested this on himself by accident.  We wandered off on a tangent about the creation of unique product names (specifically we were talking about [Soylent](http://soylent.me/)), and ended up at http://soylent.me/.  Omar realized that all he did was type "soy" into his address bar - he'd been there before, and arrived on the page without even thinking about it.

So why worry then?  Let's move the site to rp3.io, right?  Not so fast, Omar tells us.  The issue for brand managers occurs in non-digital mediums.  Just like 20 years ago, many people didn't understand what that .com URL was, today big brands avoid non-.com domains like the plague because in out of home or on the radio, there's a lot of fear that consumers won't recall domains ending in .co, .io or .brand.  

Evidently, this poses less of a problem for digitally native brands and services that don't feel the need to advertise in "traditional" channels.  In fact, many of those brands employ "spelling hacks" - like [Bit.ly](http://bit.ly/), [Ti.me](http://ti.me/) or [Ma.tt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt/). (Technically, these don't all require "hipster" domains; .ly is the official TLD for Libya, which was possible before the expansion took place.)

This fear is interesting, because it mirrors usability issues with other attempts at connecting traditional media to online properties; I'm looking at you, QR codes.  The rather massive failure of QR codes as a consumer capture technique is multifaceted; everything from a lack of vendor technology adoption to a lack of human readable affordance in the codes to poorly thought out environmental planning (putting them in the metro where there's no mobile reception) made them a poor intermediary for connecting the analog world to the digital.

If a .com address is Midtown Manhattan, is your business hip enough for .io address more akin to Brooklyn's Williamsburg?
