#The Facebookization of Twitter

Oh Twitter.  What happened?  You've seemed so lost for so long...

Last week, [Amanda examined how photos affect engagement](#) on Twitter when brands are posting content.  It's clear Twitter is driving to become a photo-based service, or at least to make photos more important.  It still feels awkward, months after they switched to this interface, to try to tweet from the app.

Okay, so now what?  A blank text box and photos?  It feels like such a blatant attempt at saying "We do photos too!!!!!  Don't leave us for Instagram!!!"  (Which of course is precisely what I found myself be doing.)   

The 140 character limit is Twitter's killer feature because it forces you to focus.  "Omit needless words," as either Strunk or White put it so well.

Post-IPO Twitter has been desperate to grow, and they seem to be doing okay on signups (which is a measure of growing).  They're just failing on engagement - people don't get it and leave.

It's true - Twitter doesn't really make a lot of sense to new users.  I'm connected to a lot of people who never post anything.

(I was going to include my first tweet here, but Twitter doesn't let me go back that far anymore.)

Have they considered another possibility - that maybe by watering down their product, making it "simpler" for new users, they're actually making it worse for existing users, and might end up losing us too?
