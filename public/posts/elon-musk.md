#As Transparent as Elon Musk
######Co-authored with Julie Smith


I recently had the privilege to spend some time with my family in wine country. After an extensive tour of the fresh produce and grape vines at the Hudson Valley vineyard, we sat down on the estate’s balcony overlooking the vast amounts of Napa vine and enjoying a bottle of the vineyard’s finest, the Old Master.
 
Following some very serious topics such as the controversial topic on if Golden Oreos are greater than regular Oreos and the fact that you can really have access to Oreos and Bob Marley music anywhere in the country, we got on the topic of transparency and collaboration.

I had heard these term sused over in over as of our agency’s pillar values. I saw this value as just an important trait to have in the advertising industry in making sure process and pricing remains clean and open with our client, I didn’t acknowledge its greater potential impact. I realized that it also establishes a sense of community and social responsibility to our industry.
 
It is transparency that funds innovation and advancement, such as seen in the ageless Wine industry. 

My father commented that the key to good industry is to be "as transparent as Elon Musk". He explained that Elon Musk had shared all of his groundbreaking industrial secrets and opened up his patents for the world to use at their disposal. This was unheard of and frowned upon by many business leaders as a way of weakness. What is the benefit of taking away your breadwinning product, your shamoo?  
 
The gentlemen of Hudson vineyard went on to explain how this idea of community and transparency is the primary factor for Napa's success and in staking its claim as "wine county". Every year the Napa area vineyard leaders get together to share their secrets for success and ideas of improvements in the wine industry. All questions are not only answered they are used as the boiler plate for innovation in the industry. 

Robert Mondavi established the need for this idea exchange. He was adamant in his belief that in order for Napa to be seen as the home of utmost place for wine, the vineyards of Napa need to unite and work in junction with one another to seek any individual growth to any specific vineyard. One vineyard will not find success if they don't share their learning’s and build off the learning’s of others. Mutual beneficiaries It's members have joined together to improve the total grape ___ everywhere in Napa.
